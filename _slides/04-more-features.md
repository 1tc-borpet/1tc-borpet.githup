## More Features

- IDs are dynamically assigned by JavaScript...
- ...but you can also assign your own, bringing the best of both worlds
- Incremental display of slide contents (just add `class="delayed"`)
- Slide scaling based on window size (size everything you want to be scalable in ems)
- Document.title changing according to slide title (fetched either from the `title`
  attribute or the slide's heading)
